                    <p>One of the most beautiful cities in America, San Francisco should 
                    be on everyone's must-see list. The ocean and hills provide a stunning
                     natural setting, but the quaint neighborhoods, historic sites, green 
                     spaces, inspiring cultural institutions, and relaxed attitude are what
                     truly make this city special.
                     The iconic Golden Gate Bridge is one of the key sights and what many
                      people call to mind when they think of the San Francisco, and even 
                      California. The orange frame against the blue water of
                       San Francisco Bay, or rising out of the fog that often covers the 
                       area is an unforgettable sight. You can appreciate the bridge from 
                       afar or, for a more personal experience, drive over it, walk on it, 
                       or even bike across it.Other popular tourist attractions include 
                       Fisherman's Wharf and the infamous Alcatraz Island. This former jail 
                       is now a national park and well worth a visit. Ferries leave for the
                        island from Pier 33 near Fisherman's Wharf.</p>

                    <p>Yosemite has long been a place of inspiration for
                     artists, climbers, and nature lovers. Beginning in the 1920s, 
                     Ansel Adams' stunning black-and-white photographs of Yosemite drew 
                     attention to the park's breathtaking landscapes and iconic sites like 
                    never before.Following WWII, climbers descended on the park and agonized
                     over how to ascend the magnificent sheer walls. In their attempts, 
                     failures, and eventual successes, they created a cult following in 
                     Yosemite like no other climbing area in history.And all along, 
                     campers and hikers have been coming here to lose themselves in the 
                     park's magnificent mountains and valleys.</p>

                    <p>Disneyland, located in Anaheim, is California's premier
                     family destination and has been for decades. This massive amusement
                      park is home to all kinds of rides, games, shows, and entertainment, 
                      complete with restaurants and hotels. The park is a combination of
                       theme rides and recreated worlds and cultures. You can find shows 
                       and other entertainment designed for both children and adults.Long line
                        ups and wait times have been reduced somewhat by the invention of FastPass+,
                         which gives you the ability to book specific ride times, a hug with a 
                         character, and entertainment events. However, when kids are out of school,
                          either for the summer, Christmas, spring break, or any other holiday, you
                           can be sure that the park will be very busy.Keep in mind there
                            is more to Disneyland than just the parks. The entire Disneyland 
                            resort experience features hotels, dining, shopping at the Downtown Disney 
                            District, and the Disney Adventure Park. Although the parks are definitely
                             what your children are here to see, you'll find something fun for everyone
                              in the family.</p>
